# Super-Google-Books-Search-Xtreme

Google Books Search allows the user look up books using the google books api. It returns the books title, the authors of the book, a book description, and a link to where you can purchase the book.

## Usage

Google Books Search is simple, and only includes a single text input form. The user uses the input to search for a book, where they are given the top ten options for their search. From their the user is given the opportunity to save the book to their saved books page, or they can foolow a link to where they can purchase the book. Users can also delete books from their saved list.

## Technologies 

This application is a MERN fullstack application that relies on React for the front end, Node and Express for the backend, and Mongodb for the database. Heroku is used to deploy the site, and Mongo Atlas is used in conjunction to that.
